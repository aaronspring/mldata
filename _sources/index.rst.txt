Weather and Climate Datasets for AI Research
============================================

Welcome to this collection of weather and climate datasets for AI research. In the last few years more and more datasets are being published. This website is an attempt at providing an overview of what's available.

The datasets are split into datasets specifically processed for AI research and commonly used raw datasets. In addition there is a list of common models for hybrid ML-physics modeling.

If you know of a dataset that is not already on the list, you can contribute in two ways:

1. Go to the `Github repository <https://github.com/pangeo-data/mldata>`_ of this site, clone it, add your paper to the respective Markdown page and create a pull request.
2. Create an `issue <https://github.com/pangeo-data/mldata/issues>`_ in the Github repository with the details of the paper and one of us will add the dataset.

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out to `me <https://raspstephan.github.io/>`_.
