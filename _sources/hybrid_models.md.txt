# Hybrid ML-Physics Models

This is a list of dynamical models thar are commonly used for research into hybrid ML-physics modeling. The list is in alphabetical order.


### Lorenz '63

### Lorenz '96
- *Reference*: [Lorenz 1996](https://www.ecmwf.int/node/10829)
- *Implementations*: [https://github.com/raspstephan/Lorenz-Online](https://github.com/raspstephan/Lorenz-Online)
- *Description*: Chaotic model. Often used in its two-layer version for parameterization research.
